Description: iterative discriminant analysis (iDA) is a dimensionality reduction 
    technique which identifies latent clustering and performs linear 
    transformations to maximally embed this clustering. iDA can take both 
    numeric matrices as well as SummarizedExperiment and SingleCellExperiment 
    objects. The output from iDA is a vector of estimated latent clustering 
    assignments as well as linear discriminants (LDs) as the embedded reduction.
